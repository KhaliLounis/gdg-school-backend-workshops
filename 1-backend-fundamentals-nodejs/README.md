# Session 1: Backend Fundamentals & Node.js

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should understand:

- What a backend is and why we need it
- The difference between frontend and backend logic
- How browser and server environments differ
- What Node.js is and why it matters
- Basic HTTP communication concepts
- Synchronous vs asynchronous programming
- Node modules and npm basics

## Key Concepts

### Backend Definition

"Backend = the part of the app that nobody sees but everyone depends on."

### Frontend vs Backend Logic

- **Frontend logic**: What the user sees and does (UI, interactions)
- **Backend logic**: What the system knows and allows (data, rules, security)

### Browser vs Server Environments

- **Browser**: DOM, window object, user events
- **Server**: Filesystem, network, databases, system access
